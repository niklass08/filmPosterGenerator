#Film Poster Generator

This project aim to learn how to create and train GAN. To do so I used a data set found on kaggle that contains URL to 40 000 thousands film posters. The aim of this project is to generate film poster based on exemple.

Examples of poster generated using this code are available here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GEUgWgGp7Izy_z1MvPA9j-D1kWDo0Nl9?usp=sharing.

A minimal version of the code is also available in this notebook (to run it you'll need to have the image data on a google drive):  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15jbzsYr7d1zCSy4x3ljyuhHuG-YchchY




Code structure is mainly inspired from : https://github.com/roatienza/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/master/Experiments/Tensorflow/GAN/dcgan_mnist.py
